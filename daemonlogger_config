# example config for setting up daemonlogger capture
# put this in /etc/config/daemonlogger after customizing

# Softflowd emits packets to localhost:9995, but we don't have anything
# listening there so we use daemonlogger to capture those packets as
# PCAP files (and we replay them using nfcapd later).
